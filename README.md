# Flash-Card-Assessment
This project is a *Flashcard Web API* built using *FastAPI* that allows students to create and retrieve flashcards. It uses *OpenRouter's Meta-LLaMA 3.3 8B* model to infer the academic subject of each question.

If the AI API fails for any reason, the app *automatically falls back* to a hardcoded rule-based subject mapping.

## Features

- Add flashcards with AI-detected subject classification
